## Steps to Implement a Decision Tree

### **1.  Import Libraries**
### **2.  Load Dataset**
### **3.  Create and Train the Model by calling the DecisionTreeClassifier() function**
### **4.  Make Predictions with train data**
### **5. Evaluate the Model based on its accuracy**
### **6. Visualize the Decision Tree**
