## Steps to Implement a Decision Tree

### **1.  Import Libraries**
### **2.  Load Dataset**
### **3.  Create and Train the Model by calling the DecisionTreeClassifier() function**
### **4.  Make Predictions with train data**
### **5. Evaluate the Model based on its accuracy**
### **6. Visualize the Decision Tree**


# Some definitions of functions in the code 


**df.select_dtypes(include=['object'])**  â†’ Selects columns that contain text (categorical) data.

**.columns** â†’ Gets the names of those columns.
Prints out the categorical column names so you can see which ones need conversion.

**pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True):**


*   Creates new columns for each unique category (One-Hot Encoding).
*   Replaces text values with 0s and 1s.


*  Removes one category (drop_first=True) to avoid redundancy (Dummy Variable Trap)
